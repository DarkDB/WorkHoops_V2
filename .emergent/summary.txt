The AI engineer successfully transitioned the WorkHoops application from an initial FastAPI/React/MongoDB MVP to a Next.js 14 (App Router) architecture, incorporating TypeScript, Prisma (initially PostgreSQL, then SQLite for local development), NextAuth, Stripe, Resend, and AWS S3 (later pivoted to Supabase Storage). The process involved meticulous setup of the new project structure, database schema definition, and core utility implementations for authentication, emails, and payments.

However, the AI engineer faced significant environmental and implementation challenges, including persistent network issues preventing Supabase (PostgreSQL) database connection, misconfigured backend                          RUNNING   pid 41, uptime 0:00:01

A critical recurring issue was the AI's tendency to overwrite existing frontend pages, which caused user frustration and required repeated clarification to only add new features while preserving existing ones. Despite these setbacks, the AI demonstrated resilience, adapting the database to SQLite and rebuilding affected UI components multiple times to meet evolving user demands. The current state has a fully laid out frontend UI, but is non-operational due to build errors from duplicated function definitions in , hindering testing of the newly integrated backend functionalities.

<code_architecture>
The project pivoted from a React frontend with a FastAPI backend and MongoDB to a Next.js 14 (App Router) application. The  and  directories are now subsumed by the new Next.js structure, which was moved into  due to supervisor configuration constraints.


**Key Files and Changes:**
*   : Updated for Next.js, Prisma, NextAuth, Tailwind, Shadcn.
*   : Defines application models for PostgreSQL. Modified to  for local development.
*   : Configures NextAuth.js, currently simplified to credentials provider.
*   : Contains various utility functions (formatting, labels, etc.). Currently has duplicate function definitions causing a build error.
*   : Root layout, now includes , , and .
*   : Updated for a minimalist design with emojis and links to all new pages.
*   : Newly created with legal links.
*   : Newly created for RGPD compliance.
*   : A new API endpoint created for populating the SQLite database with test data.
*   : New API endpoint for user registration.
*   : Implemented with pricing cards for different plans.
*   : All new pages created to fulfill detailed product requirements.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Fix duplicate function definitions in  to resolve the current build error.
- Fully connect database logic to frontend components (e.g., opportunities page displaying real data).
- Implement the full application system for users to apply to opportunities.
- Integrate Stripe for payment processing for Pro/Featured plans.
- Integrate Resend for transactional emails.
- Implement file uploads using Supabase Storage.
- Develop the system for saving favorite opportunities.
- Create email alert notifications based on saved filters.
- Implement the verification process for profiles/organizations.
- Develop a basic Admin panel for content moderation and user management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user-reported build error. The application is currently failing to compile due to multiple duplicate function definitions within . Specifically, , , , and  are defined more than once in this file, leading to a compilation failure that prevents the application from running or being tested.

Prior to this critical error, significant progress was made on FASE 1: Base funcional. This involved:
1.  **Database Setup:** A local SQLite database () was successfully set up and schema-adapted () due to persistent container network issues preventing connection to Supabase PostgreSQL.
2.  **Authentication:** NextAuth.js was configured, and a functional login/registration flow was implemented using the credentials provider. Users can now authenticate with test credentials.
3.  **Data Seeding:** An API endpoint () was created and successfully used to populate the local SQLite database with initial test data (4 users, 2 organizations, 3 opportunities).
4.  **Frontend UI Completion:** All required frontend pages and components have been created and integrated, including the homepage, pricing plans, authentication pages, dashboard, opportunities listing (though not yet fully connected to dynamic data), publish offer, talent profile, resources, about, contact, press, and legal pages (privacy, terms, cookies) with a functional cookie banner and a comprehensive footer. The navigation bar was also refined to be more minimalist and emoji-based as per user feedback.

The application is in a state where the UI/UX is largely complete and aligned with requirements, and the foundational backend (local database, authentication) is operational, but a build error is currently preventing execution.
