The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive effort in extending WorkHoops functionality, particularly around user profile onboarding and associated database and frontend logic. Key achievements include the successful implementation of a multi-step player profile onboarding, including form components, API endpoints, and initial data validation. A significant portion of the work involved persistent debugging of deployment failures and client-side errors, often stemming from misconfigurations in Prisma schema, database providers (SQLite vs. PostgreSQL), and enum mismatches. The engineer systematically addressed these by standardizing on PostgreSQL, updating schemas, and refining data handling in components and API routes. The latest phase involved extending the multi-step onboarding to Coach and Club/Agency roles, creating their respective form components, API endpoints, and critical Supabase migration scripts with RLS. The current focus is on refining profile completion percentage calculation and ensuring profiles display correctly on the talent page.

<product_requirements>
The WorkHoops platform aims to connect Spanish basketball stakeholders with opportunities, featuring offer display/publishing, talent profiles, Stripe payments, NextAuth.js authentication, file uploads (Supabase), Resend emails, and an admin panel. The MVP successfully delivered robust authentication, paid publishing, an application system, RBAC, and Zod validation. The application has stable registration/login, user profile management, Stripe annual plans, comprehensive talent profile creation, and opportunity publishing. Recent updates include full opportunity editing, an admin dashboard for offer/user/resource management, dynamic offer publishing limits, an application system, and a multi-step profile onboarding system tailored for Player, Coach, and Club/Agency roles. The goal is to provide a personalized, guided experience for users to complete their profiles upon registration, with continuous progress saving.

<code_architecture>

- ****: Central database schema. Updated extensively to include , , , , , and  models.  and  enums were also updated/corrected to reflect the application's actual usage. The provider was explicitly set to .
- ****: Environment variables. Cleaned to exclusively use  for PostgreSQL, removing local SQLite references.
- ****: Zod schemas for API validation. Updated  and  to handle optional fields during auto-save.
- ****: Player onboarding step for media links. Existed as a placeholder and was verified.
- ****: New API endpoint for creating/updating player profiles through the multi-step form.
- ****: Dashboard page. Modified to include conditional redirection for users (Jugador, Entrenador, Club/Agencia) without complete profiles, and added Completar perfil / Editar perfil buttons based on profile status. User query was updated to fetch , , .
- ****: Main onboarding page. Logic added to detect user role and render the appropriate multi-step onboarding component (, , ).
- ****: Main component for player multi-step onboarding. Corrected  and  issues for null/empty profile data.
- ****: Player onboarding step. Fixed an issue with  having an empty string , changing it to none and mapping it back to empty string for persistence.
- ****: Individual player profile display page. Enhanced to display the newly collected detailed player profile information.
- ****: Admin user management page. Corrected field name from  to  when querying .
- ****: API for  profile management. Updated to use new schema fields (, etc.) and included a temporary compatibility mapping for old frontend data.
- ****: New components for each step of the Coach onboarding form.
- ****: Main component for Coach multi-step onboarding.
- ****: New API endpoint for creating/updating coach profiles.
- ****: New components for each step of the Club/Agency onboarding form.
- ****: Main component for Club/Agency multi-step onboarding.
- ****: New API endpoint for creating/updating club/agency profiles.
- ****: SQL script for creating new  and  tables.
- ****: SQL script for defining Row Level Security policies.
- ****: Documentation for Supabase migration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding the profile completion percentage and visibility on the talent page. The user reported that the dashboard's profile progress bar was not filling correctly, and profiles were not appearing on the main talent page as expected.

The AI engineer has identified that the current percentage calculation is too basic. The work has begun to refine the  logic for both the Coach and Club/Agency onboarding API endpoints:
- ****: The  function has been updated to include a broader set of important fields from the  model, moving beyond a basic 8-field check to ensure a more accurate reflection of profile completeness.
- ****: Similarly, the  function has been enhanced to consider more comprehensive fields from the  model.

The next immediate steps planned are to:
1. Update the dashboard to correctly display the enhanced percentage.
2. Implement filtering on the talent page () to only show profiles that meet a minimum completion threshold (e.g., 50%). The engineer is currently investigating the API endpoint used by the client-side talent profiles page to apply this filtering.
