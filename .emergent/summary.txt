The AI engineer successfully built an initial MVP for WorkHoops using a FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. This included a functional frontend with key pages (Home, Opportunities, Publish, Talent) and a backend API providing data, confirmed via screenshots and  tests. After this initial delivery, the user requested a significant architectural pivot to implement Fase 1 with production quality using Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma/PostgreSQL, NextAuth, AWS S3, Stripe, and Resend/Postmark. The AI engineer has adapted well, meticulously setting up the new project, defining the database schema, creating core utilities for integrations and security, and developing a substantial portion of the new Next.js API routes. The process demonstrates adaptability and adherence to complex, evolving requirements.

The goal is to create WorkHoops, a professional, fast web platform for basketball opportunities in Spain, targeting amateur/semi-pro players, coaches, clubs, scouts, and brands. It aims to connect talent with opportunities like trials, tournaments, scholarships, jobs, and sponsorships. The platform requires ES/CAT language options, a professional, inclusive tone, and a specific brand style (colors: #111111, #FF6A00, #FFFFFF, #F5F6F8, #0B84FF; fonts: Inter, Chivo). Key pages include Home, Opportunities (list/detail), Publish Offer, Talent, Resources, About, Pricing, Contact, and Auth. Initial MVP featured CMS-populated data, forms with integrations, reusable components, and SEO.

**Current (Phase 1) Requirements:** Implement robust authentication (NextAuth with JWT, Magic Link, OAuth Google/Apple), basic file uploads via AWS S3 presigned URLs, Stripe integration for paid opportunity publishing, and a functional application system. The tech stack has pivoted to Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Prisma/PostgreSQL. It must include RBAC (admin, org, user), Zod validation, rate limiting, accessibility (AA), and minimal UI for login, registration, dashboard, and core flows.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI.
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, FastAPI (initial MVP), Prisma (ORM), PostgreSQL, Zod (validation).
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (JWT, Magic Link, OAuth).
- **Integrations:** AWS S3 (presigned URLs), Stripe (Checkout, Webhooks), Resend/Postmark (Emails).
- **Security/Performance:** Rate Limiting (Upstash Redis), DOMPurify, CSRF, Helmet headers.

<code_architecture>
The project underwent a significant architectural pivot. Initially, it was a React frontend () communicating with a FastAPI backend () and MongoDB. The AI created  for FastAPI endpoints and  for MongoDB, along with  and various page/component  files in the React frontend.

The current architecture is a Next.js 14 (App Router) application. The previous  and  directories are effectively replaced by this new structure.


**Key Changes & Importance:**
*   : Updated with all new Next.js, Prisma, NextAuth, and utility dependencies. Essential for the new stack.
*   : Central to the new data layer, defining the PostgreSQL schema and relationships for the application's entities.
*   : Critical for implementing the requested robust authentication flows.
*   : Enables secure file uploads as specified in Phase 1 requirements.
*    and : Implement the payment processing for publishing opportunities.
*   : Contains all backend logic, replacing the previous FastAPI  for handling requests.
*   : New TypeScript-based Shadcn UI components for a consistent, modern UI.

- Advanced search functionalities (filters, full-text search, saved searches, recommendations).
- A full-fledged Admin Dashboard for content moderation, user/verification management, and analytics.
- Enhanced performance optimizations (WebP, lazy loading, SSR/SSG, caching).
- Comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, E2E).
- Monitoring and analytics integration.
- Advanced security features beyond Phase 1 (CSRF, XSS, audit logs, data backup).
- Full legal compliance processes (Right to be Forgotten, consent logs).
- Production infrastructure setup (custom domain, SSL, CDN, CI/CD).
- Complete i18n implementation beyond default ES/CAT readiness.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing Fase 1 of the WorkHoops platform. This phase involves a fundamental shift from the initial FastAPI/React/MongoDB architecture to a Next.js 14 (App Router) application with TypeScript, Prisma/PostgreSQL, NextAuth, AWS S3, Stripe, and transactional emails (Resend/Postmark).

Significant progress has been made:
1.  **Project Foundation:** The new Next.js project structure has been established, including , , , , and .
2.  **Database Layer:** The  directory is set up with  defining all required data models (User, Organization, Opportunity, Application, Favorite, AuditLog). Initial database migrations () and a  script for populating basic data have been created.
3.  **Core Libraries & Integrations:** Critical utility files under  have been written, covering Prisma client initialization, NextAuth configuration, Zod validation schemas, email service setup, AWS S3 presigned URL generation, Stripe API integration, rate limiting, and HTML sanitization. Custom NextAuth types () are also in place.
4.  **UI Components:** A foundational set of Shadcn UI components in TypeScript () like , , , , , , , and  have been created, along with a  component.
5.  **API Endpoints:** A substantial part of the Next.js API routes () has been implemented. This includes the  route for authentication,  for S3 presigned URLs,  and  for managing opportunities,  and  for handling applications,  for payment sessions,  for processing payment events, and  for managing organization data. Global CSS () has also been set up.

The current state reflects a robust backend API and data layer, with core UI components ready, but the frontend pages and authentication middleware are yet to be fully integrated and displayed.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to create the authentication middleware and the main pages (, , , , etc.) for the Next.js application.
