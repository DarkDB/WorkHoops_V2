The AI engineer's trajectory showcases an iterative development process, starting with crucial Vercel deployment stabilization (Prisma, Supabase connection pooling) and quickly moving into feature expansion. Initial focus was on resolving  and , followed by implementing core functionalities like talent profiles, Stripe payments, and a refined user dashboard. Subsequent work involved meticulous debugging of compilation errors (TypeScript type mismatches, dynamic server usage in Next.js API routes) and numerous UI/UX improvements based on detailed user feedback. Key challenges included correcting Stripe integration for annual plans, refining role-based access controls, enhancing contact mechanisms with email notifications via Resend, and building out differentiated user experiences for various roles. The engineer consistently addressed issues, refactored code (e.g., removing redundant  field), and modularized components to handle increasing complexity.

The WorkHoops platform connects basketball stakeholders in Spain with opportunities, featuring a modern Next.js UI in Spanish, compliant with RGPD. It aims to offer displaying/publishing opportunities, talent profiles, Stripe payments, NextAuth.js authentication, file uploads (AWS S3/Supabase Storage - planned), Resend emails, favorites, and an admin panel. The initial MVP focused on robust authentication, paid publishing, an application system, role-based access control (RBAC), and Zod validation.

So far, the application has stable user registration, login, and basic dashboard views. Deployment issues with Supabase (Prisma connection, pgbouncer incompatibility) have been largely resolved. Key features implemented include user profile management, Stripe payment initiation (including annual plans and correct pricing), a comprehensive talent profile creation/display system with public listings, and initial opportunity publishing with basic checks and role-based access.

Recent improvements and pending work include:
1.  **Stripe Integration:** Correct annual plan pricing on  page (from 4.99€ to 39€) and update button text.
2.  **User Profiles & Contact:**
    *   Implement Contactar button logic on talent profiles: collect name/email/message, activate based on Plan Pro status, show Upgrade Plan modal with benefits for non-Pro users, and notify interest for non-Pro profiles.
    *   Ensure profile photo upload and display.
    *   Ensure contact/interest emails are sent via Resend.
3.  **Dashboard & Notifications:**
    *   Show missing items for profile completion.
    *   Differentiate dashboard for Jugador/Entrenador (applications, profile) vs. Club/Agencia (published offers, candidates).
    *   Display interest notifications in the user dashboard.
4.  **Content & UI:**
    *   Update CEO info on Sobre WorkHoops page.
    *   Change 2 months free to 4 months free on plans page.
    *   Remove duplicate Nivel field in Publicar oferta form.
    *   Fix 400 error on Publicar oferta form.
    *   Remove/change Colaboramos con section.
    *   Add Testimonios section to homepage and Sobre page.
    *   Replace team photos with icons/avatars.
    *   Fix broken image on Talento page.
5.  **Club/Agency Profile & Opportunities:**
    *   Create specific profile fields for Club/Agencia (name, type, categories, location, description, logo, social links, contact person).
    *   Implement full edit functionality for published opportunities in the Club/Agency dashboard, including a functional Ver button.
6.  **Admin Dashboard (Future):** Verify offers, manage resources, and a CRM for users/subscriptions.
