The AI engineer's work has been a comprehensive journey focusing on stabilizing, deploying, and expanding the WorkHoops application. Initially, efforts were directed at resolving critical Vercel deployment issues, primarily addressing  caused by  running during Vercel builds, and later  due to Supabase Connection Pooling (PgBouncer) incompatibilities, which required adding  to the .

Following deployment stabilization, the engineer addressed several user-reported functional and UI/UX issues. Key developments included implementing user profile pages, integrating Stripe payments, and creating a functional talent profile system with a dedicated database schema, API endpoints, and public listing pages. The process involved meticulous debugging of compilation errors related to Prisma schema mismatches and duplicate code. The current phase involves refining existing features based on detailed user feedback, such as contact functionality on talent profiles and access control for publishing opportunities.

The WorkHoops platform connects basketball stakeholders in Spain with opportunities, featuring a modern Next.js UI in Spanish, compliant with RGPD. Core functionalities include displaying/publishing opportunities, talent profiles, Stripe payments, NextAuth.js authentication, file uploads (AWS S3/Supabase Storage - planned), Resend emails, favorites, and an admin panel.

The initial MVP (Fase 1) focused on robust authentication, file uploads, paid publishing via Stripe, an application system, role-based access control (RBAC), Zod validation, and a minimal UI. The goal is to evolve this into a feature-rich platform.

So far, the application has stable user registration, login, and basic dashboard views. Authentication redirection, navigation links, button styling, and footer information have been fixed. Vercel deployment issues with Supabase (Prisma connection,  incompatibility) have been largely resolved. Key features like user profile management, Stripe payment initiation, favorites system, and a comprehensive talent profile creation/display system (with public listings) have been implemented. The application allows opportunity publishing with basic checks, but needs refinement on role-based access.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a list of critical improvements provided by the user (Chat Message 439) following a successful Vercel deployment and the completion of the core talent profile system.

Specifically, the AI engineer has started working on:
1.  **MEJORA 1: Contactar button on individual talent profiles.** This involves adding logic to , creating a new  component, and setting up a new API endpoint  for handling contact requests.
2.  **MEJORA 2: Fixing the Todos los roles filter** on the  listing page. This involves modifying the page to make the filter functional.
3.  **MEJORA 3: Restricting access to the Publicar oferta page** so only club/agencia roles can publish. The AI engineer was just beginning this task when the trajectory concluded.

The most recent action was starting work on MEJORA 3. The context indicates a strong focus on enhancing existing features and fixing user-reported UI/UX and functional issues.
